			<p>Kaitlyn currently has two pets; she has an Australian Green Tree Frog named Saiki and a red and black betta fish named Helvetica. On top of being very passionate about plants, she also has a strong passion for caring for reptiles and fish. One of the first ways we bonded when we first met was by talking about aquariums and fish facts. </p>
