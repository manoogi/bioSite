			<h2>Kaitlyn</h2>
			<p>Kaitlyn was born in Holdredge Nebraska, and moved to the town of North Platte Nebraska when she was around two years old where she grew up for most of her life. After completing high school, she moved to Chadron to complete her college degree in Applied mathematics with a specialization in computing.
